#  Assignment 1

## MileStone 1

### Summary

This first milestone requires me to create a CheckList App that runs on iOS in the XCode simulator.

It will be a simple user interface that displays the following:
- A static check list with a title
- At least four check list items
- Some check list items should be checked and some unchecked

I'll need to implement version control for the project using git with XCode's built in source control.

I'll be referencing the iOS "Reminders" application for the user interface as it has a similar functionality and a good user interface.

### What I've learnt

- Generic Swift syntax (functions, if statements, variable declaration)
- Tables and regular/compact formatting
- Lists and how to strcuture them
- System UI Icons and Images
- Checklists aren't an inbuilt type but can be implemented using a list and images
- Expanding component views into other functions to make code more readable
- Structs and classes
- Basic Swift Unit Testing

### What I've implemented

- A list using a custom struct
- Updated the list to be a checklist using a HStack and system icons
- A function that generates and returns an example list 
- A unit test that validates the example list returned by the function
